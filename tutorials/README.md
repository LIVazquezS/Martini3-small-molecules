## Parametrization strategy

The models contained in this database have been developed following the Martini 3 guidelines.
The procedure used is described in the following tutorial 
["Martini 3 tutorials: Parametrizing a new small molecule"](https://github.com/ricalessandri/small-molecules-3.0/blob/main/tutorials/M3tutorials--parameterizing-a-new-small-molecule.md) (that is also available 
on the [*cgmartini.nl* website](http://cgmartini.nl/index.php/martini-3-tutorials/parameterizing-a-new-small-molecule).

**NOTE**: the tutorial still assumes the Martini 3 open-beta version, but it will be updated in early August.
